# Stock Analysis - VBA Challenge
## Project Overview
A friend has asked to do analysis on the tickers in the stock market so he could give his parents guidance on selecting which stock they want to invest in. After writing a code to do that, we decided to see if there is a more efficient/quicker way to analyize the stocks in the market. 
## Analysis 
In the original code used to analyze the stocks in 2017, 2 for loops were used to comb pver the data and output the results.
